/**
 * Holds a precomputed multi-partition filter bitset and manages its device-memory lifecycle.
 *
 * <p>The packed {@code long[]} host arrays are immutable after construction. A single shared device
 * allocation is uploaded lazily on first use and reused thereafter.
 *
 * <h2>Device pool configuration</h2>
 *
 * <p>Filter bitset device allocations use a shared, process-lifetime resources object with a
 * growable RMM pool initially sized to 4 MiB. Applications can set the
 * {@code com.nvidia.cuvs.filterBitsetPoolSize} system property before the first filter bitset upload
 * to customize it: zero explicitly disables pooling, while a positive value selects the initial
 * size. An invalid or negative value produces a warning and uses the 4 MiB default.
 *
 * <p>The initial size is a reservation, not a memory cap or a host-side cache policy. The pool can
 * grow as needed.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <p>The handle is reference-counted. Construction grants one initial reference, held by the owner
 * (typically a host-level cache), which is released by {@link #close()}. A thread that uses the
 * handle concurrently — e.g. while it may be evicted and closed by another thread — must guard the
 * use with {@link #tryIncRef()} / {@link #decRef()}. The shared device allocation is released only
 * when the last reference is dropped, so a concurrent {@link #close()} cannot free memory that is
 * still in use.
 *
 * @since 25.10
