// Concrete non-template overloads for all supported index types.
// Previously a single template <T, IdxT, DatasetViewT> covered all index types; it has been
// replaced with explicit overloads to maintain a stable non-template ABI. When a new index

/** @brief Add new vectors to a CAGRA index
 *
 * Note: `extend` does not concatenate datasets. The caller owns the final dataset and must
 * pre-populate a single padded device matrix of size `(n_old + n_new) x dim` (or overallocation
 * with a view whose logical `n_rows` is `n_old + n_new`):
 *   - rows `[0, new_start_row)` hold the original vectors attached to `idx`
 *   - rows `[new_start_row, n_rows)` hold the additional vectors
 * `new_start_row` must equal `idx.size()` today. The library only extends the graph and rebinds
 * the index to `extended_dataset`. Keep that view alive for the index lifetime.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * @code{.cpp}
 *   using namespace cuvs::neighbors;
 *   // Build `extended` = old || new on device, padded for CAGRA.
 *   auto extended = make_device_padded_dataset(res, concatenated_view);
 *   auto extended_view = extended->as_dataset_view();
 *
 *   cagra::extend_params params;
 *   int64_t new_start_row = static_cast<int64_t>(index.size());
 *   cagra::extend(res, params, extended_view, new_start_row, index);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param[in] handle raft resources
 * @param[in] params extend params
 * @param[in] extended_dataset caller-owned device-padded view already containing old || new rows
 * @param[in] new_start_row row index where the additional vectors begin (must equal `idx.size()`)
 * @param[in,out] idx CAGRA index; graph is extended and dataset view is rebound

 *
 * The overload without `merge_params` uses `merge_algo::AUTO`. AUTO runs Fastener only after a
 * non-mutating preflight validates every input and option; otherwise it calls the existing rebuild
 * implementation. REBUILD always preserves every input dataset.
 *
 * Fastener supports unfiltered, uncompressed `float`, `half`, `int8_t`, and `uint8_t`
 * indices using L2Expanded and `uint32_t` graph IDs. Fastener uses `root_fanout` at the first
 * split and `lower_fanout` at every later split. Fanouts from 1 through 32, leader fractions in
 * (0, 1], leader caps through 8192, leaf sizes from 1 through 256, and leaf degrees from 1
 * through 8 are supported. The configured spill width times `leaf_degree` must not exceed 255.
 * `index_params::graph_degree` is the final output degree.
 *
 * Fastener copies the input datasets into `merged_dataset` and never mutates the input indices.
 * The caller owns `merged_dataset` and must keep it alive for the lifetime of the returned index,
 * which holds only a view of it.
 *
 * @note This API only supports physical merge (`merge_strategy = MERGE_STRATEGY_PHYSICAL`).
 * All input indices must use the same `DatasetViewT` (dense padded or standard device views),
 * and must share one row stride.
 *
 * @param[in] res RAFT resources used for the merge.
 * @param[in] params Parameters for the returned CAGRA index.
 * @param[in] indices CAGRA indices to merge.
 * @param[in] merged_dataset Caller-owned storage for the consolidated dataset. Must have one row
 * per retained vector after applying `row_filter`, and the same dimension and stride as the input
 * datasets.
 * @param[in] row_filter Optional row filter. Any filter selects rebuild in AUTO and is rejected by
 * explicit FASTENER.
 * @return The merged physical CAGRA index.
